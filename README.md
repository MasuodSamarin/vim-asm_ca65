# vim-syntax-asm_ca65
Vim syntax highlighting for the `ca65` assembler.

## Purpose

This codebase provides `asm_ca65.vim`, a Vim syntax-highlighting module for the
`ca65` assembler.

`ca65` is a full-featured assembler for the 6502 family of microprocessors,
which powered such historic platforms as the KIM I, Apple II, Commodore 64, and
Nintendo Entertainment System. It is a part of the popular `cc65` suite of
development tools for the 6502, which also includes a C compiler, linker, object
dumper, etc. `ca65` is designed both for direct use by assembly programmers and
as the compilation target of the `cc65` C compiler. `ca65` is especially used by
"homebrew" communities for the NES, SNES, etc.

The stock Vim runtime distribution includes syntax modules for several dialects
of assembly, as well as a "generic" module (which is really for the GNU
Assembler), none of which works particularly well with 6502 assembly
conventions, and especially not with `ca65`'s many added features in particular.
